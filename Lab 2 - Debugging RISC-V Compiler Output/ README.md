In our previous lab, we compiled our C code using both gcc and a RISC-V compiler.

Now, we will examine the output file generated by compiling the C code with the RISC-V compiler and debug the instructions.

Steps followed
1) Inspect the output generated by compiling the code with the gcc compiler, located in the file 'a.out'
2) Inspect the output generated by compiling the code with the RISC-V compiler, located in the file 'sum1toN.o'. and Check whether the outputs are the same or not

4) Now we start debugging using the spike debugger
5) We will allow the Spike debugger to run until the main function, specifically until the **100b0** instruction. After that, we will manually continue debugging and inspect the **a0** register before and after the execution. We observe that the instruction **lui a0, 0x21** updates the a0 register from **0x0000000000000001** to **0x0000000000021000**

6) Next, we will manually debug the next instruction  i.e., **addi sp, sp, -16**. This instruction decrements the stack pointer (sp) by 16. Before executing this instruction, the sp register held the value **0x0000003ffffffb50**, which is then updated to **0x0000003ffffffb40**
