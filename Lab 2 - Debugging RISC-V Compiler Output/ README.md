## In our previous lab, we compiled our C code using both gcc and a RISC-V compiler. Now, we will examine the output file generated by compiling the C code with the RISC-V compiler and debug the instructions.

Steps followed
1) Inspect the output generated by compiling the code with the gcc compiler, located in the file 'a.out'
2) Inspect the output generated by compiling the code with the RISC-V compiler, located in the file 'sum1toN.o'. and Check wheather the ouputs are same or not
3) Now we start debugging using spike debugger
4) We will let spike debugger to debug till the main function i.e., 100b0 instruction, later we will manully debug
